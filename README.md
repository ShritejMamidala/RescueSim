## 🧠 What is RescueSim?

**RescueSim** is a training simulator for 911 dispatchers, designed to mimic real emergency call scenarios and provide detailed, AI-generated feedback. Trainees can interact with simulated callers using either:

- **📝 Text-to-Text Mode**: Communicate with the system through a chat-style interface.
- **🗣️ Speech-to-Speech Mode**: Engage in realistic voice-based conversations using speech recognition and synthesis.

Each session is evaluated by an AI-powered backend that provides structured feedback on performance, decision-making, and communication clarity.
